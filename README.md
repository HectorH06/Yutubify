### General Description

```diff
- Made within a single night
```

## Installation

1. Install requirements with the following command :

   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. You got to create a dev spotify account and get your client_id and client_secret (on the dashboard create an app and get your creds)

3. Create a new project, enable youtube api v3 and create credentials, fill the form and then create OAuth id, then download the json

4. Place both last steps on a single file named secrets.json

5. Publish your app on youtube, and sign in with the mail you created the project, then trust it and that's pretty much all

## Features

- Transforms spotify playlists into youtube playlists or so

## Future Features

- I MIGHT add support for youtube to spotify lists
